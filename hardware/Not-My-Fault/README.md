## Description
"Of this one thing make sure against your dying day - that your faults die before you do." - Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Letters from a Stoic

## Building/Deployment
This challenge has a Python server script that players need to connect to.
I included a Dockerfile in build/ which spawns on a hardcoded port 1337, change it as needed.
