- Players are given a username: mch4cker1337
- After checking various social media apps, they find his twitter: https://x.com/mch4cker1337
- A few posts down, he mentions creating a Steam account with the same username and mistyping a single letter of his username. From another post, he mentions his favorite number is 8.
- So, players will try variations of his username on Steam until they find him on Steam: mch4cker1338 (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199688578291)
- On his Steam public profile, you will find in the profile comments, a youtube channel from his friend Martini Craft: https://www.youtube.com/@martini-craft
- The oldest video on the Youtube channel will say "Flag 1" in the description and have the first flag spelled throughout the gameplay in the 2.5 hour long video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8B0tS_wcIo)
- In the comments of that youtube video, there will be a link to a Reddit profile: https://www.reddit.com/user/Feisty-Schedule1097/
- On the reddit profile, they will see some removed comments, they have to use the Revedit tool to see the deleted comments: https://www.reveddit.com/y/feisty-schedule1097/?all=true&removal_status=all
- One of the deleted comments will have a link to a Discord server: https://discord.gg/962JwKdE
- Flag 2 will be in the topic of the #general channel
- Reading the conversation in the Discord will reveal a chess.com account: https://www.chess.com/member/m4rt1nicraft
- A big red herring in the conversation is that Martini left some sensitive info in his chess.com profile, and that he removed it. This should be a glaring hint to wayback his account profile: https://web.archive.org/web/20240520023121/https://www.chess.com/member/m4rt1nicraft
- In the waybacked profile, there is his gmail: caravaggioluca599@gmail.com 
- If you use GHunt OR another tool like Epieos (https://epieos.com/?q=caravaggioluca599%40gmail.com&t=email) you will find his public Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=caravaggioluca599@gmail.com
- On his calendar next week there is an Event called "Secret Memorial Day Gamer Meetup" with his Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/tf4rc_1n1tr4m_733132/
- Flag 3 will be split up into 2 posts on the Instagram account
- The third post will show a restaurant called Atwood's Pizza and a hint about bus routes, this will be useful (although not strictly necessary) to find Flag 4 (Martini Craft's apartment complex where he lives)
- From subsequent conversations in the Discord server, there are more hints about where Martini Craft lives. (1) Players can geosint the image of the building to find that he lives in the Atlanta area close to Midtown (2) He says he lives across from a gas station (3) There is a Subway down the street from where he lives. With this information, and also the optional 4th clue about the bus routes from the instagram, it should be relatively simple to narrow down the apartment complexes and find that Martini Craft lives at The Local on 14th St
